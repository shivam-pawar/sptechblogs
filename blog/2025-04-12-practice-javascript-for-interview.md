# Practice JavaScript for Interview

## Basic Concepts
<details>
  <summary>1. What is Javascript?</summary>

  Javascript is **lightweight**, **interpreted** scripting language primarily used for creating **interactive web pages**.

  It is **single threaded** with asynchronous capabilities using callbacks, promises and **async/await**.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. What are the different data types in JavaScript?</summary>

- Primitive types: String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, Bigint.
- Non-primitive: Object (Including Arrays and Functions).
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. What is Hoisting?</summary>
Hoisting is JavaScript mechanism where variables and functions are moved to the top of their containing scope (either function or global scope) during the compilation phase, before the code is executed.

This means you can use certain variables and functions before they are actually declared in code.

- Function Hoisting
  Function declarations are hoisted with their full definition, so they can be called before they're written in the code.
  ```js
  sayHello(); //Output: Hello!

  function sayHello(){
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
  ```
- Variable Hoisting - *var*   
  *var* declaration are hoisted, but only the declaration, not the initialization. It's value remain *undefined* until the assignment reached.
  ```js
  console.log(x); //Output: undefined
  var x = 10;
  ```

- Variable Hoisting - *let* or *const*  
  let and const are also hoisted, but they are in **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** from the start of the block until the declaration is encountered, so accessing then before that throws an error (*ReferenceError*).
  ```js
  console.log(y); // ‚ùåReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization.
  let y = 20;
  ```
