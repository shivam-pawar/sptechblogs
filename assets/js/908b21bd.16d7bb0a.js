Note that we are passing 3 parameters to our replaceAll() method which is different than the actual replaceAll() method but both will give desired output.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no implementation of replaceAll() present in version of ECMAScript12 that\u2019s why we get this error. To fix this, we had a workaround which will use replace() method to do exact thing which replaceAll() does.\\r\\n\\r\\n> If you found this article useful, please share it with your friends and colleagues!\u2764\ufe0f\\r\\n\\r\\nThis article was originally published [here](https://dev.to/shivampawar/fix-replaceall-is-not-a-function-in-javascript-3klp)"}]}')}}]);
